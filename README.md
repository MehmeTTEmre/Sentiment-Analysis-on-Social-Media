# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter
In this project, I designed a graphical user interface for a twitter account that analyzes the desired number of tweets in a specified time period according to 5 different moods. We store information such as ID, user name and tweet text of the tweet data, both in a database and in an excel file. In addition, the data of any twitter account can be automatically retrieved as a diary.
